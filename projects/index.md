## [GooDrive](http://iamprem.github.io/goodrive/)
[GooDrive](http://iamprem.github.io/goodrive/) is trying to be the most functional Google Drive Client available today for linux. We already have few Google Drive client programs(Grive, Grive2, GoogleDriveJavaClient) written for linux by great programmers and they definitely inspired me a lot. The reason i started this project is, I found that existing Google Drive clients lack key features and those are not supported by the developers recently and also it is very unlikely to see an official version of Google Drive client on linux any time soon.

## [FaceStats](http://iamprem.github.io/FaceStats/)
[FaceStats](http://iamprem.github.io/FaceStats/) is a simple iOS application that uses facebook's open graph API to collect user activity from the feeds and present a visualization of it. Though its not most functional app, this project was to learn Apple's Swift and get a confidence to learn any new language.

## [Customer Review Summarizer](http://iamprem.github.io/summarizer)
The idea of this project is to build a model for e-commerce data that summarize large amount of customer reviews of a product to give an overview about the product. The result of this model can be used to get an overview of what are the most important reviews that many customers complaining or praising about a particular product without reading all of the reviews. The main tasks involved in this project are data collection, data cleaning, implementation of two summarization algorithms and getting the final summary in a distributed computing framework using Apache Spark.

## [Social Gesture Classification on Accelerometer data](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/social-gesture-classification)
The goal of this project is to predict the gesture performed by a user wearing an Axivity AX3 smartwatch. The data consists of the x,y,z components of the accelerometer readings sampled at 50Hz with a Â±4G gravity threshold and was collected from multiple volunteers, who performed 12 different actions. Achieved final classification accuracy of **96.04%** and scored one of the best in the competition hosted on [kaggle.com](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/social-gesture-classification/leaderboard/public)
